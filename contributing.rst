Contributing
============

Gluster Infrastructure is open to code contributions. Almost all of our
infrastructure is handled with code. If you cannot contribute to a particular
piece of infrastructure in our code repos, that's a bug. Please talk to us.

The primary place for most contributions is our `ansible repository`_ on
Github. The `infrastructure documentation`_ is also maintained on Github and is
open to contribution.

The CI system is also open to contribution in terms of new jobs and
maintainting the existing scripts. Jenkins jobs are managed by `Jenkins Job
Builder`_. The `test scripts`_ that actually power our tests are in a different
repository on Github and is open for contribution too.
