Emergencies
===========
Nobody likes it when enough attention isn't paid to an urgent infra request. We
don't like it when our days are constantly interrupted either. This document is
intended to serve as a guide to define what is an emergency and who to contact
in case of emergency.

What is an emergency
--------------------
Any downtime of essential services will be a "**code red**". Situations which
are currently preventing our users from using services which we are reasonably
expected to provide them, or which are stopping our developers from working. As
such, the following services fall into essential services:

* review.gluster.org
* build.gluster.org
* download.gluster.org

Please file a bug and get in touch with corresponding point of contacts for the
respective service immediately. In a code red situation, *all* work will be
paused until the issue is resolved.

What is not an emergency
------------------------
Issues which affect developers/users but can be mitigated trivially, like
a build node that's acting up. It can be deactivated by multiple team members.
